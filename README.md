# Markdown LearningCards
 A tool to create Anki-LearningCards with Markdown-Files.
 
 ### What is the current status?
 The code can create a simple html site from the given Markdown-Files inside the directory.

 ### What is the next goal?
 Adding a first way to create a card to anki from a Markdown-File inside of the directory of this project.

 ### What is the motivation behind this project?
 I want to use this tool to create flashcards in anki through my notes from Obsidian without the extra effort of typing my own flashcards. 
 Instead the cards should be created through this tool.
